## Running Python Interpreter
The Python interpreter lets you enter 
Once installed, open a command prompt (windows) or terminal (mac) and enter the
command (do not include the $ symbol):
```bash
$ python
```

This will launch the python interpreter. Note: if you get "command not found", 
you can try ```python3``` or a version specific command such as
```python3.10```
See here for more information: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html 

## Python Files
A python file is a file that ends with the .py extension.
You can run python files by using the command line/terminal and entering
the command:

```bash
$ python your-python-file-name.py
```
